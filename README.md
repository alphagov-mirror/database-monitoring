# Database monitoring

## About

This is a repository for diagnostic queries that can be run on a database to diagnose performance problems.

The code is in the form of pre-compiled functions/procedures that can be installed on your database. These functions/procedures can be run on an ad-hoc basis whenever performance problems, such as slow-running queries, are experienced.
